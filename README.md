## What is Randomized?
- Tool Recipes
- Gun and Ammo Recipes (including casings)
- Ability to Smelt Bars, Refine Wood, and Alien Resources
- Distance Triggers (requires "access passes"" to travel beyond certain points)
- Killing an enemy for the first time (may expect certain tiers of weapon)

## What is the Goal?
- Defeat the Undead Dragon
- Travel 5000m to complete a round trip around the game world
Once both of these are complete, check of the Victory condition to win!

## Kill Quest Logic
*What is expected by the game for you to kill certain enemies in order for you to not punch dragons to death?*
**__Nothing__**
Common Zombie
Red Zombie
Green Zombie
Archer Skeleton
Fire Dragon (you are potentially expected to kill this with your starter weapons)
**__Brass Casing Recipes__** (i.e. low tier guns)
Sand Zombie
Grey Hell Zombie
White Sword Skeleton
Tundra Skeleton
Dual-Axe Skeleton
Forest Dragon
Sand Dragon
**__Gold or Higher Casing Recipes__** (i.e. higher tier guns)
Hell Lord
Alien
Ice Dragon
Undead Dragon (This is part 1 of 2 for the **Victory Condition**, the other being travel 5000m to complete a round trip around the game world.)

## Distance Logic 
*What are the required items before traveling past certain distances, as distance is the goal in endurance mode?*
Travel 50m - Nothing
Travel 200m - Brass Casing Recipe (logic will expect you to be reliably armed before roaming any farther)
Travel 500m - Elevated Forest Access Item
Travel 1000m - Desert Access Item (and all previous access passes)
Travel 2300m - Mountain Access Item (and all previous access passes)
Travel 3000m - Tundra Access Item (and all previous access passes)
Travel 3600m - Orelands Access Item AND Hell on Earth Access Item (and all previous access passes, plus Orelands isn't always present but just in case it is now an extra obstacle there.)
Travel 5000m - All previous access passes (This is part 2 of 2 for the **Victory condition**, the other being kill the Undead Dragon)
