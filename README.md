## What is Randomized?
- Tool Recipes
- Gun and Ammo Recipes (including casings)
- Ability to Smelt Bars, Refine Wood, and Alien Resources
- Distance Triggers (requires "access passes"" to travel beyond certain points)
- Killing an enemy for the first time (may expect certain tiers of weapon)

## Biome Access
You will need these to beat the game. You are able to access the first biome, The Forest, as you spawn here in the game. However in order to travel further out into other biomes you are required to have the corresponding Biome Pass item before you can travel to that location. The biomes in order are Elevated Forest, Desert, Mountain, Tundra, and Hell on Earth. There are also two optional zones you may get access too, Underground Hell which lets you enter hell from the underground; then there is also the Orelands, which is a rare biome that can spawn as your travel further out. You need the Orelands Mining Pass to mine in any occurance of the Orelands but you do not need a pass in order to cross through it as it is unpredictable how they spawn in your world.

## Progressive Tools
This is the level of tools (Pickaxe/Axe/Shovel) you are able to craft at a given time. You can craft at your highest tier or below once you've unlocked it. You begin the game with Stone level tools, each Progressive Tools upgrade grants you access to Copper (1), Iron (2), Gold (3), Diamond (4), Bloodstone (5). Each tier is required by progression for *something*.

## Weapons and Ammo
Like progressive tools, you are able to craft at your highest tier of below once you've unlocked a Progressive Weapon, though only for that specific weapon. You are considered to start with no weapon, despite endurance mode granting you a pistol and 200 bullets. You are expected to use this to kill the early kill tasks which will unlock access early to a new firearm as well as a Progressive Ammunition. Progressive Small Weapon grants you access to Iron (1), Gold (2), Diamond (3), Bloodstone (4), and Alien (5) per tier specifically for Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, and SMGs. Progressive Big Weapons is the same, however it is AK's and LMGs. Logic only ever expects Gold level at a specific weapon tier, but the rest are included as they can be incredibly useful to have. You also need the corresponding Progressive Ammunition tier which matches up with the tier of weapon you are using. I.e. Progressive Ammunition (1) allows you to make standard bullets for your iron guns, Progressive Ammunition (2) allows you to make bullets for your gold guns, and so on. Anything outside of the starting forest biome and anything in hell requires Gold guns or higher (not including early dragons or special night-time enemies)

## Victory Condition
In order to complete the seed, you are required to have complete both of the following....
1. Defeated the Undead Dragon, then send the check for it.
2. Complete a Round Trip, then send the check for it.
Once both of these are completed you can then check off the victory location labelled "Undead Dragon Defeated and Round Trip Completed".

This means to beat the seed you require (at a bare minimum)
```
Elevated Forest Access, Desert Access, Mountain Access, Tundra Access, Hell on Earth Access, Wood Refining, Copper Bar Refining, Iron Bar Refining, Gold Bar Refining, 1 Small and 1 Big Weapon, 2 Progressive Ammunitions, 2 Progressive Tools.
```
This could require more items (especially if you are playing this solo without any other worlds in your multiworld).
